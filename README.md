## Introduction

This repository includes projects and assignments related to AI and Machine Learning, showcasing different algorithms, models, and techniques. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a particular concept in AI/ML.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

# AI-ML-Submission

- `project1/`, `project2/`, etc.: Each directory contains the code and data for a specific project.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the dependencies required for the projects.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/adnaan-tariq/AI-ML-Submission.git
    cd AI-ML-Submission
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to run the code and use the project. Generally, you can navigate to the project directory and follow the provided instructions.
